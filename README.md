Python Version 2.7

An automated procedure for extracting and georeferencing raster BAM files from AHAS and converting them to an Esri ArcGIS consumable format.

AHAS: The Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) was constructed with the best available geospatial bird data to reduce the risk of bird collisions with aircraft. Its use for flight planning can reduce the likelihood of a bird collision but will not eliminate the risk. The AHAS organizations are not liable for losses incurred as a result of bird strikes.

BAM: The United States Air Force has developed a Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology as a key tool for analysis and correlation of bird habitat, migration, and breeding characteristics, combined with key environmental, and man-made geospatial data.

Requirements:
    -Standalone Python script.
    -Python version 2.7
    -This script requires the use of ArcGIS 10.1 or greater.
    -See requirements.txt for full list of required python modules
    -Be aware that this script accesses a public facing DOD information system that is under DOD surveillance.  Travel to the website manually first if you are interested in seeing the disclaimer discussing this surveillance.
